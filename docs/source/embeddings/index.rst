Embeddings
==========

    Embeddings create a vector representation of a piece of text. The idea behind embeddings is to map words or phrases to vectors of real numbers in a way that captures semantic relationship between them. These vector representations are learned from data and are used to encode semantic information about the words or documents.

    There are lots of embedding model providers. Now we supported Huggingface and OpenAI models. Future will enable other embeddings model.

Installation
============

**Install with pip:**

You should install Semantic AI in a virtual environment. If youâ€™re unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, take a look at this guide. A virtual environment makes it easier to manage different projects, and avoid compatibility issues between dependencies.

Start by creating a virtual environment in your project directory:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ python -m venv .env

Activate the virtual environment. On Linux and MacOs:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ source .env/bin/activate

Activate Virtual environment on Windows

.. code-block:: shell

    $ .env/Scripts/activate

To install Semantic AI run:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install semantic-ai
